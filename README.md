Rain Prediction in Australia
Welcome to the Rain Prediction in Australia project repository! In this project, we will explore and apply various machine learning algorithms to predict whether there will be rain in Australia on the following day. The dataset we'll be working with comes from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. Our goal is to build a classifier that can effectively predict rain based on various meteorological features.

Project Overview
As part of this project, we will be leveraging the skills we've acquired over five weeks of machine learning training. The primary objective is to develop a notebook where we can implement and evaluate different classification algorithms for rain prediction.

Dataset
The dataset we'll be using is sourced from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology. It contains valuable information about weather conditions, and our task is to predict whether there will be rain the next day based on the available features.

You can download the dataset from the Australian Government's Bureau of Meteorology or use an alternative source of your choice.

Algorithms Used
We will employ a variety of machine learning algorithms to build and evaluate our rain prediction models. The following algorithms are part of our analysis:

Linear Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Decision Trees
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Evaluation Metrics
The performance of our models will be assessed using the following evaluation metrics:

Accuracy Score: Measures the ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total number of instances.
Jaccard Index: Calculates the similarity between predicted and actual classes.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two metrics.
LogLoss: Relevant for probabilistic predictions, quantifies the accuracy of predicted probabilities.
Mean Absolute Error: Measures the average absolute differences between predicted and actual values.
Mean Squared Error: Measures the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.
R2-Score: Evaluates the proportion of the variance for the dependent variable that's predictable from the independent variables.
Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
